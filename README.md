### Objective

Crack the 4-digit code by making clever guesses. Each guess gets feedback based on the color of the blocks.

### Gameplay

1. Enter your 4-digit guess.

2. The game will change the color of each block:

   * **Green:** The digit is in the right spot.

   * **Yellow:** The digit is in the code but not in the right spot.

   * **White:** The digit is not in the code.

3. Use the feedback to improve your guesses and break the code.

### Tips

1. Look for patterns in the color feedback.

2. Rule out possibilities based on the clues.

3. Think logically to make fewer guesses.
